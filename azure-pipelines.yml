# We want to build for .NET Standard (implemented by both .NET Core and the .NET Framework desktop)
# Add steps that run tests, create a NuGet package, deploy, and more:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/dotnet-core

# the build will trigger on any changes to the master branch
trigger:
- master

# the build will run on a Microsoft hosted agent, using the lastest Windows VM Image
pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

# these variables are available throughout the build file
# just the build configuration is defined, in this case we are building Release packages
variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

#The build has 3 seperate tasks run under 1 step
steps:
    
# The first task is the dotnet command build, pointing to our csproj file
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  displayName: 'dotnet build'
  inputs:
    command: 'build'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
    projects: 'carwings.net/carwings.net.csproj'

# The second task is dotnet pack command again pointing to the csproj file
# The nobuild means the project will not be compiled before running pack, because its already built in above step
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  displayName: "dotnet pack"
  inputs:
    command: 'pack'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
    packagesToPack: 'carwings.net/carwings.net.csproj'
    nobuild: true
    versioningScheme: 'off'
